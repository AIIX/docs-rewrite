# Repurposing **Skills** developed for other platforms

It is not straightforward to repurpose **Skills** developed for other platforms, like [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial), for Mycroft. The key reason for this is that other platforms use different programming languages. For example, Amazon Alexa uses the [Lambda language](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and is tightly integrated with the Amazon Web Services platform.

That said, having the _structure_ or _logical flow_ of your **Skill** well defined already makes it easier to start development of your Mycroft **Skills**.

# Choosing to use Mycroft  
Why would you choose to use Mycroft over alternatives such as Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™?

Great question!

While alternative tools are readily available, and easy to use, they come with some pretty big downsides.

## Open source

Mycroft is open source. This means that the code used by Mycroft can be inspected, copied, modified, and contributed back to the Mycroft community for everyone to enjoy.

Tools like Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™ are _black boxes_. That is, you can't look inside them, and see what they do - or importantly - _how_ they do it. And while they may allow you some flexibility to create new **Skills**, these are usually strictly controlled. Mycroft gives you freedom, flexibility and control over how your want _your_ voice assistant to work. Mycroft is AI for _everyone_.

Mycroft code is licensed under the [Apache 2 open source license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License).

Mycroft uses _opt-in privacy_. This means we will only record what you say to Mycroft with your explicit permission. Don't want us to record your voice? No problem! If you'd like us to help Mycroft become more accurate, you can opt in to have your voice anonymously recorded.

## More hardware, more choices

Mycroft runs on a wide range of software platforms and hardware - meaning that you can run Mycroft on the **Devices** _you_ want. Try Mycroft on a Raspberry Pi, on an Android device - or on your Linux desktop.

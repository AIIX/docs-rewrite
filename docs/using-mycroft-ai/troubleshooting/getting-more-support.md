## Asking for help

### What you need

Help us to help you. When you contact Mycroft for support, we may ask for some of the following information:

* What type of Mycroft **Device** you're using, such as Mark 1, Picroft, KDE Plasmoid and so on
* Whether your **Device** was **Paired**
* Your home.mycroft.ai account details
* Information from your Mycroft logs
* Information generated from the [Support Skill](https://github.com/krisgesling/docs-rewrite/tree/176ae0df61c549a0327446919daf7686dc76bb46/docs/using-mycroft-ai/troubleshooting/README.md#using-the-support-skill)

### Where to ask

#### Community Forums

The best place to post most support questions is the Community Forums. This enables the many experienced members of our Community to assist you in a timely manner. Once a solution is found, it also means that others who may face the same problem in the future can benefit from your experience.
Post in the Support Category of the Community Forums.

#### Community Chat

The Community also has a real-time Chat service. This is useful to have direct discussion about your issue. Please be mindful that we are a global Community and someone may not respond immediately to your message. Be sure to provide enough detail so that when someone does come online they can understand what is happening.
Join the Troubleshooting channel in Chat.

#### Github Issues

If you have discovered a technical issue and are aware of which Mycroft component it relates to, these can be logged as issues on Github. If you are unsure, you can always ask in the Chat.

#### Mycroft Team

Where needed, the Mycroft Team are also happy to help. You can email queries to support@mycroft.ai and a team member will respond when available.

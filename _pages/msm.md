## What is Mycroft Skills Manager - msm?

Mycroft Skills Manager (msm) is a command line tool used to add, manage and remove **Skills** on any Mycroft installation. It can install any **Skill** listed on the [Mycroft Skills Repository](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills). `msm` is a handy tool for Developers and those who may frequently reconfigure, install and uninstall **Skills**.

## Using Mycroft Skills Manager - msm

`msm` has recently been rewritten in Python (`msm` was previously a `bash` script). In order to use `msm`, you will first need to enter the Mycroft _virtual environment_, `venv`, using the following command:

`mycroft-core$ source .venv/bin/activate`

``(.venv) kathyreid@kathyreid-N76VZ:~/mycroft-core$``

You can then run `msm`:

`(.venv) kathyreid@kathyreid-N76VZ:~/mycroft-core$ msm update`

To see a list of all the available `msm` commands, type `msm -h`:

```
(.venv) kathyreid@kathyreid-N76VZ:~/mycroft-core$ msm -h

Search is very handy functionality if you're looking for a particular **Skill**:

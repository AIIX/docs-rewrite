<h1>Teaching Mycroft New Vocabulary</h1>
Ever said something to Mycroft, and it didn't respond how you thought it would?

Do you say:
<ul>
 	<li>"Set a 30 second timer";</li>
 	<li>"Start a timer for 30 seconds"; or</li>
 	<li>"Time 30 seconds for me"</li>
</ul>
They all make sense when you hear them, but you've had at least a decade (probably a few) to learn that. It takes Mycroft time to learn that all these variations really mean the same thing too. We need your help in tracking down all of the relevant phrases (known as Utterances) that users might use to trigger different skills.
<h3><strong>A quick overview of how Mycroft handles a request:</strong></h3>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Wake Word</strong> - <em>"Hey Mycroft"</em> - activates the listening mode</li>
 	<li><strong>Utterance</strong> - <em>"Set a timer for 5 minutes"</em> - the users request is spoken and Mycroft processes this speech into text</li>
 	<li><strong>Intent Parsing</strong> - Mycroft decodes the Utterance and directs this to the most appropriate Skill based on the registered Intent Handlers</li>
 	<li><strong>Skill Invocation</strong> - Skills can have one or more Intent Handlers that perform various functions and usually respond with some Dialog</li>
 	<li><strong>Dialog</strong> - <em>"Okay, 5 minutes starting now"</em> - Mycroft translates the dialog from text to speech, and provides that response to the user.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Help us to turbocharge Mycroft's learning </strong></h3>
Using the form below, tell us any Utterances that haven't worked for you, and which Skill it should have triggered.

If nothing comes to mind, you can also pick a skill to test. We've listed some priority skills at the top of the drop-down list below. Just make sure the skill is installed, and start talking naturally to Mycroft. Then let us know what didn't work.  <strong>
</strong>

For each Skill you would like to make suggestions for, please submit a new copy of this form. If you run into any trouble, let us know in <a href="https://chat.mycroft.ai/community/channels/tell-gez">Mycroft Chat</a>.

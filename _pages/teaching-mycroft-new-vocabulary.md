<h1>Teaching Mycroft New Vocabulary</h1>
Ever said something to Mycroft, and it didn't respond how you thought it would?

Do you say:
<ul>
 	<li>"Set a 30 second timer";</li>
 	<li>"Start a timer for 30 seconds"; or</li>
 	<li>"Time 30 seconds for me"</li>
</ul>
They all make sense when you hear them, but you've had at least a decade (probably a few) to learn that. It takes Mycroft time to learn that all these variations really mean the same thing too.

<strong>Help us to turbocharge Mycroft's learning by telling us new phrases that make sense for you.</strong>

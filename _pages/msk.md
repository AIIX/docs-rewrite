# Mycroft Skills Kit - msk

## Introduction

The Mycroft Skills Kit - `msk` - is a Python-based utility that has been created to make it easier for **Skill** Authors to create, test and submit **Skills** to the [Mycroft Skills Repo](https://github.com/mycroftai/mycroft-skills). We hope this utility helps to shorten the development cycle, and remove some of the tedious parts of **Skill** creation.

`msk` currently supports the following features:

- Create a new **Skill**
- Create an `Intent` test for a **Skill**
- Upload a **Skill**
- Upgrade an existing **Skill**

## Installing msk

_NOTE: `msk` has only been tested on Linux systems_

`msk` comes pre installed on the [Mark 1](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/mark-1), [Picroft](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft) and in the `venv` of the Mycroft `git` installation as of v18.2.9b. The utility is self-contained and can be installed separately using `pip` by typing the following line into the terminal on your Linux system:

```bash
pip3 install msk
```

You should then see output like the below:

```bash

To check that the installation was successful `msk --help` can be run and should list the arguments and options for the utility.


## Usage

```bash
msk create
msk create-test /opt/mycroft/skills/myskill
msk upload /opt/mycroft/skills/myskill
msk upgrade /opt/mycroft/skills/myskill
```

## Create

Please see this ASCII Cinema video to see the process for using `msk create`:

[![msk-create](https://images2.imgbox.com/ab/25/6kbqKbXh_o.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/X5pWLPOpsMLUPYp5kgswNm5Zu?speed=1.5)

If using the msk delivered with the mycroft-core github installation the Python _virtual environment_ needs to be activated. From the mycroft-core directory run

`$ source .venv/bin/activate`

Next, we use the `msk create` function. You will be prompted to enter the required information to help set up your **Skill**.

```bash
$ msk create
Enter a short unique skill name (ie. "siren alarm" or "pizza orderer"):
Feed the Corgi

Class name: FeedTheCorgiSkill
Repo name: feed-the-corgi-skill

Looks good? (Y/n) Y
Enter a one line description for your skill (ie. Orders fresh pizzas from the store): Reminds you to feed your poor starving Corgi
Enter a long description:
> Every 24 hours, Mycroft will send you a reminder to feed your Corgi, and tell you what your Corgi was fed the previous day, so you can provide a different delicious meal for your precious Corgi.
>
Enter some example phrases to trigger your skill:
- Have I fed the Corgi today
- What did I feed the Corgi yesterday
- Remind me to feed the Corgi at 5pm
-
Enter author: YourGitHubUserName
Would you like to create a GitHub repo for it? (Y/n) Y

```

Now, if you look in `/opt/mycroft/skills/` you will see that all the files required for the **Skill** have now been created, including the `.voc` files.

```bash
$ ls -las /opt/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill

```

## Create test

`msk` also provides a function for creating `Intent` tests, as part of our [Automated Testing for Skills](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/automatic-testing/).

Please see this ASCII Cinema video to see the process for using `msk create-test`:

[![msk-create-test](https://images2.imgbox.com/9c/c8/gLRS7xuL_o.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/Ayzaj6QJbKGBfs2eIQWr11idH?speed=1.5)

As before if the mycroft-core github installation is used make sure to activate the mycroft-core Python _virtual environment_. From the mycroft-core folder

`$ source .venv/bin/activate`

Next, we use the `msk create-test` function. You _must_ pass the **Skill** directory location to the command, or it will fail.

```bash
$ msk create-test /opt/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/

Which intent would you like to test?
1. corgi.the.feed.intent

> 1

=== Intent Examples ===
Corgi the feed

Enter an example query: have I fed the corgi today?

Choose expected dialog (leave empty to skip).
1. corgi.the.feed

> 1
Generated test file: /opt/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/test/intent/corgi.the.feed.intent.0.intent.json
```

If we have a look inside the `corgi.the.feed.intent.0.intent.json` file we can see that the test has been created for us.

```json
$ cat /opt/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/test/intent/corgi.the.feed.intent.0.intent.json
{
    "intent_type": "corgi.the.feed",
    "expected_dialog": "corgi.the.feed",
    "utterance": "have I fed the corgi today?"
}
```

## Upload Skill

`msk` also provides a function for uploading a **Skill** to the [Mycroft Skills Repo](https://github.com/mycroftai/mycroft-skills), as part of our [Skill Submission Process] (https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/skill-submission/).

Please see this ASCII Cinema video to see the process for using `msk upload`:

[![msk-upload](https://images2.imgbox.com/35/5d/BCVxUxuh_o.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/Bp1sORVnmVz9wYjZXfempTPoO?speed=1.5)

If using the msk delivered with the mycroft-core github installation the Python _virtual environment_ needs to be activated. From the mycroft-core directory run

`$ source .venv/bin/activate`

Next, we use the `msk upload` command with the path to the **Skill**:

```bash
$ msk upload /opt/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/

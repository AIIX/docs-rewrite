<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have Mark II PCB prototypes! The two circuit boards, the Main Board and the Mic Board, form the Brains and Ears of our Mark II. </span><a href="https://aaware.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our partners on the hardware, have been hard at work designing these boards. Last week, they hit a major milestone. We received the first boards from the prototype board manufacturer. Aaware started testing the boards, and so far so good. When firing up the boards for the first time, it is important to take things slow and make sure everything is working properly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far they have tested the Memory, the SD card reader, Wifi chip, USB interface, thermal profile, power, and all systems are go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is still a lot left to do before this board becomes our final Mark II.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of the things that Aaware is focusing on over the next few weeks to get to a working prototype stage.</span></h2>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get stable Linux image running from SDcard</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get WiFi running and tested/validated. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bringup I2C drivers in Linux and test PMIC and LCD touch interface</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bringup mic interface, run our mic diagnostic, get the Aaware sound capture daemon running</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bring up DAC interface, test/debug/validate DACAMP (sound system)</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Start LCD driver test/debugging</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned for more updates in the following weeks. This is a very exciting milestone.</span>

<h3>We wanted to take a minute to say CONGRATS to the new <a href="http://www.techstars.com/">Techstars</a> class!</h3>
<h3>Trust us, you've made a great decision.</h3>
We've scanned the <a href="http://www.techstars.com/content/accelerators/announcing-first-class-techstars-kansas-city-accelerator/">roster of 2017 companies</a> and couldn't be more impressed. It's a list full of opportunity, inspiration, and ambition--not that we expected anything less from Techstars.

Moreover, welcome to Kansas City! We're confident you'll find Midwestern authenticity and charm in our city and people, along with a thriving entrepreneurial community.

Don't be afraid to ask for directions, do try the barbecue, and of course, <em>do more faster. </em>[/vc_column_text][divider line_type="No Line" custom_height="30"][image_with_animation image_url="30623" alignment="center" animation="Fade In" box_shadow="none" max_width="100%"][divider line_type="No Line" custom_height="30"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" overlay_strength="0.3"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" width="1/1" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][vc_column_text]
<h3>Notes from a Techstars Alum:</h3>
Mycroft went through the Sprint Accelorator, powered by Techstars in 2016. The program has since transitioned to solely Techstars, and took up rent in an awesome new co-working space.

Nonetheless, this accelerator dramatically changed the course of our company. It was a period of ideation, iteration, and expansion. All aided by the second-to-none mentorship and network that Techstars provides. So a word from the wise; take <em>full</em> advantage of your time there.

Top three things we took from Techstars
<ol>
 	<li>A giving, hardworking network</li>
 	<li>Diversity of thought</li>
 	<li>Global reach and connections</li>
</ol>
<h3>Don't hesitate to tap on peoples shoulders, make connections, friendships, and working relationships. Congratulations!</h3>

<i>This blog post is primarily for our readers who have a technical background; if you are non-technical, you can safely ignore it. </i>

As our software becomes more mature, and our user base grows - we have nearly 20k registered users - we’re inevitably going to encounter security issues. Because we’ve been predominantly developer-focused over the last three years, how we handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">common exploits and vulnerabilities (CVEs)</a> is something that’s been on the backburner.

So, in a way, it’s another milestone that we’ve had our first CVE identified.

Community Member @<a href="https://github.com/nhoya">nhoya</a> recently identified a web socket server vulnerability in mycroft-core code, that, if you know how, is vulnerable to a remote code execution exploit. <a href="https://github.com/Nhoya/MycroftAI-RCE">You can read more on the exploit itself here</a>, and <a href="https://community.mycroft.ai/t/zero-click-remote-code-execution-in-mycroft-ai-vocal-assistant/3930">join the discussion on our Forum if you’re interested</a>.

First up, we’d like to take the opportunity to thank Community Member @<a href="https://github.com/nhoya">nhoya</a> for his excellent work in identifying this CVE, and for practising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsible disclosure</a>. This vulnerability was disclosed to us in confidence at Mycroft 90 days before it was made public. We assessed the impact of this issue as low risk, given that it is reasonably complex to undertake, and that it affected only the <a href="https://mycroft.ai/documentation/linux/">GitHub-based installations of Mycroft,</a> not our <a href="https://mycroft.ai/documentation/mark-1">Mark 1</a> or <a href="https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/">Picroft</a> offerings. If you’re interested in how CVEs are assessed, you can read more about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System">Common Vulnerability Scoring System here</a>.

We also saw this as an opportunity to put some more structure around the way we approach the identification, reporting, assessment and mitigation of CVEs. Prior to the web socket server vulnerability being disclosed, we hadn’t yet developed a CVE process. Being a startup, process is something that we tend to build as-needed, instead having a focus on continuous delivery of features to our end users.

However, it’s time that we put this in place.

To this end, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12cGRD3LkX5n93QOonDemW2iKvmIMqkGhsnwWjIrni4I/edit?usp=sharing">we’ve drafted a process, and we’d really like to get your feedback</a> - particularly if you practice in the infosec space. This document outlines why we need a process, what the process steps are and how the process contributes to the overall success of Mycroft AI as a company.

Let us know what you think in the forum.

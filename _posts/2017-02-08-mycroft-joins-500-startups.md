We are proud to announce that Mycroft AI has joined <em><a href="http://500.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500 Startups</a></em> in San Francisco as a part of Batch 20. 500 is regularly rated one of the top 3 accelerators in the world and has helped entrepreneurs create more than $3B in value for investors.

Mycroft was accepted into the General Motors track at 500 where the company will be working closely with mentors from GM. Executives at Mycroft will benefit from the decades of experience that GM's team brings to the program. We are excited to work with GM and learn more about how Mycroft's voice technology can improve both the driver experience and safety.

The <em>500 Startups</em> program runs from January 23 to May 11 when the teams take the stage for one of the most watched demo day programs in the nation. Past 500 graduates include 3D printer manufacturer <a href="https://www.makerbot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Makerbot</a>, cloud communications platform <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio</a>, visual content creation tools <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> and <a href="http://visual.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual.ly</a>, popular customer messaging platform <a href="https://www.intercom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intercom</a>, social marketing SaaS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire_Interactive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wildfire</a> (acquired by Google), or online learning platform <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a>, and more than forty other companies that were valued at $30M or more.

Mycroft was selected from thousands of potential applicants because the company has the potential to radically change vocal computing. Our team couldn't be happier to be there. For the next three months, our business development team will be working with 500 at their San Francisco offices.

The team is already getting mentorship from the 500 cadre and has been privileged to work with incredible people like Chris Neumann, Aaron Blumenthal, Mike Sigal and Chandini Ammineni.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft and Techweek’s Romantic History</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Techweek KC is an exciting event for us. It was at this event <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/shipping-update-and-launchkc/">last year</a> that things changed pretty significantly for the company.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were one of 20 companies selected to compete in a pitch competition during Techweek KC called Launch KC. Additionally we were given booth space to show off what we are building. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The week long event was filled with entrepreneurial mixers and parties attended by those in the KC community that help drive innovation. The Mayor of KC, Sly James, was at the opening night event. We’ve spoken a little about how groups like Techweek and those that push innovation and Entrepreneurship have a vital place in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">community, our story is just added proof.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft claimed victory at the final pitching competition, and we were one of ten companies to take home a non-diluted $50,000 grant as well as free offices. Additionally, we were selected to pitch at Techweek Nationals in Miami - where we also won.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, because of that win we moved the headquarters of Mycroft from Lawrence, KS to Kansas City, MO. It wasn’t a big move for us (just a 45 minute drive.) But it was a big move for Mycroft AI. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being based in Missouri allowed us to apply for and accept funding from the Missouri Technology Corporation. This investment made sure we could hire summer interns, many of which have stayed on as full time employees. </span>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" overlay_strength="0.3"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" width="1/1" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][vc_gallery type="nectarslider_style" images="31150,31153,31151,31152" bullet_navigation_style="see_through" onclick="link_no" img_size="900x645"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" overlay_strength="0.3"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" width="1/1" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][vc_column_text]

After a great showing at CES 2018, Mycroft will be returning to <a href="https://www.ces.tech/Topics/Startups/Startups.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CES Eureka Park</a> in Las Vegas, January 8–11, 2019.

The Mycroft Mark II will be on display, in preparation for its official release in 2019. The Mark II is the perfect smart speaker for privacy-focused consumers.

Additionally, the Mark II has been designed to be white-labeled, allowing enterprises to easily deploy their own custom, branded speaker and voice assistant for customer engagement or workplace efficiency.

CES is the perfect venue for the Mycroft community to showcase what we’ve built to leaders in smart home technology and tech retailers. We'll attract companies who support open technologies and are eager to lead their industries by deploying an AI that runs anywhere and interacts exactly like a person.

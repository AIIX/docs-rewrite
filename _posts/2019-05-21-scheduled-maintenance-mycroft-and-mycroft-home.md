At 04:00 UTC May 22, 2019, Mycroft services and home.mycroft.ai will be disabled for a major scheduled maintenance. We're updating our backend with a new system and launching a redesigned home.mycroft.ai.

<strong>The update will begin at 04:00 UTC on Wednesday, May 22. We're expecting the entire process to take about two hours.</strong>

<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Mycroft+Scheduled+Maintenance&amp;iso=20190522T04&amp;ah=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check your local time here.</a>

During this time, you will not be able to use your Mark I device, or your Picroft or Linux Desktop instances of Mycroft. No action is required by you, your devices will return to normal functionality once services are restored.

This update gives us the base we need to continue adding functionality to Mycroft, and will lead to new opportunities for skill developers in upcoming releases.

You can expect a more stable connection between Home and your device, Single Sign-On to more Mycroft web properties, deeper integrations with the Marketplace, a fresh visual interface, and even some new features.

Once the update is complete, we hope you'll explore the new site and try some of the new features. If you run into any issues or have any comments, please let us know below.

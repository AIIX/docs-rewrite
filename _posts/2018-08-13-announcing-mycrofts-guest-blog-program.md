<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft is happy to announce the ability for community members to author and publish Guest Blog Posts on <a href="https://mycroft.ai/">Mycroft.ai</a>. Ever written some content about your favorite voice assistant? Or, maybe you've had an idea for a post about the technology that makes it work, or the policy, philosophy, or societal impacts arising around it? Now you can, and have it featured on our blog!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every so often, we receive a request for guest blog posting and have now put together a process to ensure equal opportunity and quality assurance for guest content on Mycroft’s website. We’ve been testing this process with a few potential guest authors so revisions are likely, but don’t let that stop you from jumping in if you meet the criteria!</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve set these standards to consider when outlining your Guest Post and submitting:</span></h1>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest Blog Post Author</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must have expertise in the area, usually demonstrated via LinkedIn, personal blog, or videos on the topic</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest Blog Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must be related to voice, open source, or a closely related field such as voice interaction design</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content must relate to Mycroft’s products, service, or brand ethos in some way</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Guest Blog Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cannot be used to promote another platform or product; unless Mycroft already has an existing partnership with the organization.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>How about an example?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let’s say I’ve written an awesome post on how to deploy highly accurate Speech to Text with low enough processing requirements that it can be used anywhere. To prove its ability, I took my system to the jungles of Madagascar for testing. If I were to submit for a post, I’d link to my LinkedIn or personal blog, whichever best demonstrates my ability to build such a system. I’d provide a brief outline of the post, including the premise I’ll be testing my system against, how to set it up and test it yourself, what the results of my jungle test were, and the conclusion and any further reading.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Mycroft team finds promise in your outline and background, we’ll reach out with further guidelines and a blog template. We’ll then work with you to collect a draft of your post, the name and title you’ll want on the post, a headshot, and a snippet about you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll go through a few rounds of edits on your post, create a title, featured image, and collect any additional graphics you might want included. Here’s an example of what a featured image might be:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Mycroft_GUEST-BLOG-TEMPLATE-Example.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40064" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Mycroft_GUEST-BLOG-TEMPLATE-Example.png" alt="" width="5001" height="2501" /></a>Then we’re ready for publication! We’ll set a date and share your stuff with the world!</span>
<h2>What we're looking for</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for all sorts of posts, not just technical. This could be research or a survey on people’s privacy concerns in tech, an analysis of linguistic differences voice assistants struggle with, or a how-to process for building a special enclosure for a Picroft. If it meets the general criteria, don’t be shy!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope this program will bring some great awareness to our community and their work and research. Submit your topic below!</span>

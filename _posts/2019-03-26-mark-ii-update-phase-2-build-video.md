There have been many requests to show the making of the new Rockchip based prototypes. So we put together a quick montage showing some assembly of the Proof of Concept prototype and the Phase 2 prototype. The Proof of Concept utilizes a combination of laser cut panels and 3D printed parts, and the Phase 2 prototype is almost entirely 3D printed. In the video that Sam (our multi-talented Designer) put together you can see our Production Guru, Darren Courtney, assembling the prototypes.

These prototypes are optimized for our tools, so they are designed to work with a Formlabs SLA printer and an Epilog laser cutter. Our goal is to do a quick revision that is better suited for FDM printing. The FDM printed version should easily fit on a printer with an 8” x 8” build platform.

Once we validate a few other systems we will begin sharing more documentation on GitHub including the 3D files and parts list so that others can recreate our prototypes. Stay tuned for more updates.

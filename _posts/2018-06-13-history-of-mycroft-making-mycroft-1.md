After playing around with several ideas he landed on the first version of Mycroft. This was before Kickstarter, before Techstars; just the regulars at the Lawrence Center for Entrepreneurship. You can read about that <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/history-of-mycroft-origin-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first working prototype was terrible, but the <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/the-vision-for-mycroft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision was there</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From that vision came the desire to prove there was a market for an open source voice assistant. That team at the LCE built the product into a basic working model and took it to the proving ground of all crazy ideas: <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/kickstarter-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few months and a lot of hard work later we found out that there were more than a few people interested in Mycroft when we successfully funded our first Kickstarter. With the press around our success, we got the attention of Techstars for their <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-joins-2016-techstars-class-at-the-sprint-accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 Kansas City program</a>. We were accepted and that was when our little side project turned into a real company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After Techstars Demo Day we raised a Seed round of financing and <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/making-a-mycroft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipped our early developer kits</a> to Kickstarter backers. Yes, those first developer kits were individually printed and hand soldered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As 2016 progressed we continued to work on <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/crowdfunding-path-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and brought in CTO <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-welcomes-new-cto-steve-penrod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Penrod</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accelerate software development.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Things were pretty quiet for the rest of 2016, as we worked hard to deliver the Mark I. That is, until we got into <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-joins-500-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batch 20 of 500 Startups</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team continued to grow</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as we <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-and-crowdfunder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised money</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/millennium-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered the Mark I</a> in the summer of 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was an amazing learning experience and we are grateful to all of the community members who joined us in the beginning of this journey. 2017 brought many updates, including a <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/new-face-same-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new logo</a> for Mycroft</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Without our community, we would not be where we are today. Join us to continue to make Mycroft great.</span>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="center" overlay_strength="0.3" shape_divider_position="bottom" shape_type=""][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" column_border_radius="none" width="1/1" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][nectar_btn size="large" open_new_tab="true" button_style="regular" button_color_2="Accent-Color" icon_family="none" url="https://www.startengine.com/mycroft-ai?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_term=hist2" text="Invest Today on StartEngine"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

Saturday was monumental. We shipped our very first Kickstarter Early Bird Hardware Dev Kit. These dev kits are the alpha Mycrofts ordered by the developers who are helping to make Mycroft a reality. (photo credit Zach Spears)

We want to send a big "Thank you" to those in the development community coming together not only to code but give feedback on development efforts to date. We would not be where we are without you. If you would like to share your voice, join us on the <a href="https://community.mycroft.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Page</a>.

The Early Bird Hardware Development kits will ship one per day during the month of April until all are fulfilled. In May will begin shipping the Indiegogo Early Hardware Dev kits; continuing one per day. This process will allow us to work closely with our development community to bring Mycroft into beta release for July.

Our community is what has made this happen and we are grateful for your support. We will continue to communicate with you about the process going forward.

As you wait for your units to arrive, take a look at this fun "making of" video that shows how a prototype Mycroft unit is made.

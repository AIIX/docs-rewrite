<h3>Mark 1 Assembly and Shipping</h3>
It's all hands on deck at our production site. Each member of the Mycroft team has stepped away from their normal roles, and put on their production hats. Mark 1's are being individually crafted and packaged for our crowdfunding backers.
<h4>We're doing everything domestically</h4>
For those of you who know manufacturing, assembly, and fulfillment, this might sound unusual. Our team wanted total control of quality and doing it here in the Midwest allowed us to perfect that process. We've seen a steady increase in the number of units produced in a day. With everyone in the office contributing we were able to get <u>500</u> units assembled, tested, troubleshooted and packed up in one week.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Where We're At, and What Is To Come</h3>
<h4>Total Shipped: 511 | Remaining to ship: 694</h4>
If you're a US backer don't worry, your handcrafted Mark 1 will be on its way in the next few days. If you are in the international community, we're looking to begin shipping by the end of the week. We can't thank everyone enough for their continued patience.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Authenticity Guaranteed</h3>
Are we the type of startup that launched out of a 20-year-old's garage, and had a slew of serendipitous connections and luck? Not quite. But we are a small team, working towards an ambitious vision. Taking Mycroft from prototype to production has been a tumultuous road. We've navigated it by means of leaning on our teammates, late nights, constant searches for better solutions, and reminding ourselves of our commitment to the open source community and our backers. We've hacked our way to a functioning production process in the back of our office, and seen Mycroft come to life in the form of Mark 1.

Cheers to the many iterations that brought us here. Cheers to those of you, who like us, have simply <em>started something</em>. That's the hardest part.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" overlay_strength="0.3"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" width="1/1" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][image_with_animation image_url="30345" alignment="center" animation="None" box_shadow="none" max_width="100%"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" overlay_strength="0.3"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" width="1/1" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][vc_text_separator title="Meet the Faces Behind This Video"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" overlay_strength="0.3"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" width="1/4" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][image_with_animation image_url="30364" alignment="center" animation="None" box_shadow="none" max_width="100%"][divider line_type="No Line" custom_height="20"][vc_column_text]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any good company knows, brand image is important. Brand image is defined as the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impression of a product held by real or potential consumers. This is influenced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not only by how the brand presents itself as a professional venture, but also the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">literal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visual elements of the company. Brand colors, logos, typefaces, the whole brand identity. A few months ago we switched out our secondary colors for brighter, more versatile swatches; you can check those out at </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mycroft.ai/colors</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, it’s time to shake up our primary typeface and subsequently, our company logo.</span>
<h2>Type</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The type family we’ve used up until now is the Roboto family – a solid sans serif with a variety of weights and styles. And there’s nothing wrong with it aesthetically, but as a company looking to expand into a multitude of languages, we need a typeface that can support that journey. Google’s type family Noto, which is open source and free to download at </span><a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/get/noto/</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the best choice for our purposes. It supports a long list of languages, comes in a large variety of style and weights, and is visually similar to Roboto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Type-comparison-screenshot.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44169" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Type-comparison-screenshot.png" alt="Mycroft's company brand is moving to Noto font" width="2134" height="754" /></a></span>
<h2>Logo</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does this affect our logo?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, not to worry, the changes are overall pretty minor. We used an adapted version of Roboto for our logotype, so it was mostly just a matter of giving Noto the same treatment and making a few adjustments. But what’s the fun in stopping there? For our type-only logo, our logomark is incorporated in place of the O in “MYCROFT”, but neither Roboto nor Noto have a capital O that’s fully round. So, with a little customization, our logotype now has a round O and C to make things consistent across logos.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Logo-before-and-after-screenshot.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44166" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Logo-before-and-after-screenshot.png" alt="Mycroft company's new logo compared to old logo" width="1042" height="806" /></a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And speaking of consistency, Mycroft had a lot of logos in use.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ScreenShot2019-02-07at5.01.19PM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-44174 size-full" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ScreenShot2019-02-07at5.01.19PM.png" alt="Too many logos" width="1278" height="890" /></a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So we cut it down for consistency purposes. Say goodbye to the confusion over whether our brand logo is supposed to be in uppercase or lowercase!</span>

More to come!</span>

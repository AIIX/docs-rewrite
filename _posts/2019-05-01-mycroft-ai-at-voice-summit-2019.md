This July, I'll be returning to the <a href="https://whova.com/embedded/speaker_session_detail/voice_201907/610481/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VOICE Summit</a> in New Jersey to continue sharing the necessity of an open, collaborative voice solution that is independent from Big Tech.

VOICE Summit is where innovators in the field of voice gather to share ideas. <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-ai-at-voice-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I attended last year</a> to introduce the attendees to the Open Alternative in voice, and Mycroft was very well received. I’ll be working to recruit more developers into our Community, and demonstrate that they can deploy voice technology without going into orbit around the behemoths of Big Tech.

I'll also discuss the progress that open voice solutions like Mycroft made in the past year and the pitfalls of closed solutions. Big Tech continues to acquire voice technology companies. <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2018/05/21/microsoft-acquires-semantic-machines-to-make-speech-engines-more-conversational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft acquired Semantic Machines</a> last May, <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2019/02/17/apple-acquires-pullstring-as-voicebot-previously-reported-what-it-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple acquired PullString</a> in February, <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2018/12/03/jibo-shuts-down-selling-off-robot-parts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jibo's IP has been acquired</a> by a venture firm. The early voice market is understandably volatile, but users, developers, and enterprises alike can bet on an open solution being something they can maintain well into the future.
<h2>Join the Conversation</h2>
If you’ll be at <a href="https://www.voicesummit.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VOICE Summit</a>, come out and learn more. <a href="https://whova.com/embedded/speaker_session_detail/voice_201907/610481/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I present Tuesday, July 23</a> at 3:00 PM EDT in Room CK 217. I’m looking forward to meeting you!

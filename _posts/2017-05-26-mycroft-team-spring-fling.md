As a team we try to gather as many of our members as possible three to four times a year to work on team building. This time our meetup occurred during demo day for 500 Startups.

<strong>500 Startups</strong>

<a href="https://youtu.be/mYzQb6JVkCU?list=PLOStnEM8wBObQ_AwpRDHGMSJRdTFXq3ZU">Demo Day for 500 Startups</a> was May 11th and we had a marvelous time. Our team gathered in San Francisco for this event and enjoyed meeting media and investors who attended. After we spent time eating, hiking, and bonding as a team.

<strong>OSCON</strong>

During demo day, two members of our team headed to <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx">OSCON </a>to play with the Canonical team in Austin. They showcased a demo Mark 1 unit and were able to interact with members of our open source community.

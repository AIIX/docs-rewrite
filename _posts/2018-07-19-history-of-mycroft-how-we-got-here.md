<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Supported</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our community and the power of crowdfunding is important. Mycroft was not a company before we took our <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/history-of-mycroft-making-mycroft-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark I device to Kickstarter</a> and used perks-based crowdfunding to determine market interest. Because of the success of that project and the power of Kickstarter we were able to build a community of like-minded individuals to work together on an open source voice assistant. We ended up raising $193,000 total from Kickstarter and Indiegogo to produce our Mark I.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity Crowdfunding</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we made it possible for anyone to invest in Mycroft, and on the heels of our success with perks-based crowdfunding, we decided to explore </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/crowdfunding-path-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equity crowdfunding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to raise money. We used sites like </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-and-crowdfunder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, AngelList, and Fundable to source accredited investors who would support our early growth. As a young company with few connections, these sites broadened our reach and helped us fill both our Angel and Seed rounds. We ended up raising over $1.1M. When you add the $300,000 in matching funds the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLKbsyweZRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Missouri Technology Corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provided, it makes up more than half of our total investment to date. Beyond the money, these early investors have added extra value in their networks, feedback, and mentorship. That success is part of what led us to</span><a href="https://www.startengine.com/mycroft-ai?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hst4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accept investments from anyone on StartEngine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitive</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with fundraising, we found ourselves on a bit of a competitive streak. In September 2016, we took home top prizes at the </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/the-future-of-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GE FirstBuild hackathon</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> where we teamed up with future Mycroft intern Aura and her classmates from Columbus College of Art and Design. Soon after, Mycroft turned a win at LaunchKC into a </span><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/technology/article140998808.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win at Techweek’s National Pitch Competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We attended </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-joins-500-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 Startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-welcomes-jaguar-land-rover-new-investor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaguar Land Rover Tech Incubator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.necn.com/multimedia/MassChallenge-Mycroft-AI-Veripad-CareAline_NECN-441788123.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MassChallenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-takes-south-korea-k-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">K-Startup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHsGNdeFQFU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plug and Play Mobility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We participated in the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mycroft_ai/status/859893344209707009" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Everywhere Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, won a </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-takes-home-tim-award-technology-motion-conference-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology in Motion award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and showed off at </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-techcrunch-disrupt-featured-startup-alley-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most recently took home the </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-wins-data-ai-track-hello-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data and AI award at Hello Tomorrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were named a Startland News </span><a href="http://www.startlandnews.com/2018/01/2018-startups-watch-mycroft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top KC Startup to Watch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of Progress</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our success in fundraising and winning competitions allowed us to make great progress on the tech and expand the team. We traded Slack for <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mattermost-replaces-slack-chat-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source chat alternative Mattermost</a> and adopted a </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/software-version-numbers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">software versioning system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar to Ubuntu’s. We brought on Developer Relations superstar </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycoft-director-of-developer-relations-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathy Reid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/improving-mycrofts-documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled Mycroft’s docs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and helped kick off discussions around </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/languages-are-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internationalization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Later, we welcomed <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/meet-chris-mycrofts-new-lead-backend-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backend systems veteran Chris Veilleux</a>. We demoed </span><a href="https://youtu.be/6GHmzbXp_jY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft in a Jaguar F-Type</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, deployed training systems for </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/introducing-precise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/training-deep-speech-how-you-can-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeepSpeech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, developed a </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/building-strong-ai-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategy to build strong AI</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/were-in-beta-how-to-update-to-18-02b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released our Beta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The rest of the industry wasn’t sitting idle though. Google released their Duplex demo and we offered </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/congrats-on-google-duplex-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Second Kickstarter</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the success of the first Kickstarter we decided </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/kickstarter-live-check-mark-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowdfunding our Mark II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be best. Our community support has been the single biggest factor in determining our success, and again, they did not disappoint. We reached our minimum funding goal in 6 hours and went on to raise $394,000 with Kickstarter to bring the Mark II to production. To keep presales rolling, we put </span><a href="https://igg.me/at/mycroft/reft/1649210/hist4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark II on Indiegogo Indemand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you can still reserve your Mark II. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, we have worked with our community to build something they want. The way we know this is because we don’t operate behind closed walls. The developers who build Skills are most often community members. They are active in the </span><a href="https://chat.mycroft.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://community.mycroft.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://mycroftai.activehosted.com/f/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read our newsletter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every week. They keep us aware of bugs and issues, and let us know what features should be next.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Above all, we got here because of our community, who have supported us since day one.</span>

If you love open source software as much as we do, then you probably already know about <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest 2017 - a collaboration between GitHub and DigitalOcean</a> to encourage more developers to contribute back to the open source software they use. If you don't, then check out the website. In a nutshell,
<blockquote>To get a shirt, you must make <strong>four pull requests</strong> between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. Pull requests reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt.</blockquote>
Often, the hardest part of getting started with open source software is knowing where to start. To help you get your 1337 t-shirt FTW, we've<a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMycroftAI+label%3Ahacktoberfest&amp;type=Issues&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93"> tagged all our pretty-easy-to-get-started-on Issues in GitHub with the Hacktoberfest tag</a>. If there are others that you think should be tagged Hacktoberfest, shout out on GitHub, or contact our friendly developer team at <a href="https://chat.mycroft.ai">Mycroft Chat</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft has been hard at work bringing the Mark II from prototype to production. We’ve got awesome people on staff but don’t always have all the skills we need on payroll. Today we’d like to introduce two consultants who have been collaborating with Chief Design Officer Derick Schweppe to bring the Mark II to life: Carl Masters and Chris Ostrander.</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carl Masters</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Carl Masters brings years of experience at high-end speaker manufacturer Martin Logan as well as GPS technology company Garmin. Currently, Carl is teaching at the University of Kansas in addition to independent mechanical design consulting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While at Martin Logan, Carl showed his prowess in designing enclosures for high-end acoustic products that were both elegant and optimized for manufacturing. Carl sketched, designed, and visited factories for Martin Logan’s over-ear and in-ear headphones, entry-level home theater speakers, and top-of-the-line installed speakers. Martin Logan has been providing high-quality and innovative audio gear from our hometown in Lawrence, KS since 1979. Carl's work will ensure Mark II's overall design maintains its audio quality while being attractive and easy to manufacture.</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Ostrander</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Ostrander has been an inventor, industrial designer, and sound reinforcement engineer for over a decade. After graduating from the University of Kansas, he joined Marche International where he has designed a wide variety of products for clients including wireless speakers and earbuds. His work for Marche can be found in Walmart, Ace Hardware, and Home Depot.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside Marche, Chris has designed and built high-performance loudspeaker designs for touring bands. As an accomplished live sound engineer, he enjoys tuning the systems he builds. With his experience in mass production and aptitude for creative problem solving he is helping Mycroft get the best quality sound out of a small enclosure.</span>

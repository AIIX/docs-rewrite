<h3><strong>If you haven’t heard… we launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aiforeveryone/mycroft-mark-ii-the-open-voice-assistant?ref=creator_nav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter</a> at the end of January. It released our new voice assistant device, the Mark II.</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A completely open software and hardware, privacy-focused assistant loaded with features and an increasingly intelligent software stack behind it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kickstarter was 100% funded in 6.5 hours. We’ve blown past our goal of 50,000 and are currently at 280k, climbing each and every day. We can’t thank our community enough for this--it’s loyal supporters like you that brought Mycroft to life two years ago and continue to do so now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With each milestone met we’re releasing stretch goals. We went to our community, asking what they’d like to see Mark II include. Since then, we’ve released:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near Black Color Option</span></em></li>
 	<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ice Blue Color Option</span></em></li>
 	<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify and Sonos Media Skills </span></em></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we added a new reward at 200k.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark II with a Camera</span></em></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Along the way...</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to rewards, we’ve had lots of <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycroft-news-read-coverage-mark-ii-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press coverage</a> on the Mark II and some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">awesome</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community contributions, like this video. It shows how Mycroft can be integrated with facial recognition technology (perks of being open source.) Thanks to our community member, Christopher Rogers, for this!</span>

<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Chronologically, the campaign went a little liked this:</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>$200k we released the color NEAR BLACK.</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But we know backers wanted more color options. So we put out a survey to see what the community liked. The results for that became the next stretch goal.</span>
<h4><strong>At $210k we released ICE BLUE. The clear winner with our community. </strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback from the community also told us something else.. That Mark II with a Camera was a highly requested reward. We listened and released a new reward. </span>
<h4><strong>At $179 you can get Mark II with a camera.</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting a camera in a voice assistant comes with a lot of benefits. It gives you eyes where you need them--whether that’s keeping an eye on your pups while you’re out, or seeing a sleeping baby in another room. The best part is we don’t keep any data, so there’s absolutely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy invasion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The internal camera will have 1080p video with DSI interface, and a mechanical shutter to physically block the lens.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn’t forget the details: Kickstarter doesn't allow add-on rewards, so if you were a Dev Kit, Early Bird, or 3pack backer, rest assured we're working on the option to get you a camera. Most likely it will be a survey sent post campaign to let you add it to your cart.</span>
<h4><strong>At $250k the stretch goal of Spotify and Sonos integration was unlocked. This stretch goal ensures that the media skills will be available upon shipment.</strong></h4>
&nbsp;

<h3><strong>Mark II is and continues to be built by the feedback of the community. </strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/crowdfunding-lessons-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correcting the things</a> we overlooked the first time and adding in capabilities that you’re asking for. The feedback has been GREAT. In fact, we wanted to highlight a few especially great responses we heard from the survey. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we asked, “What would you like to see from Mark II?”</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just add legs and hands and paint it yellow/blue and you got minion. Modulate voice to sound like one should not be that hard too.” </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Giant fighting robot that levitates”</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wish! While not all ideas are technically or financially feasible, we still want to hear what you have to say!</span>

On May 24, 2019, <a href="https://www.neongecko.com/Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neongecko Inc.</a> released their <a href="https://neongecko.com/NeonAISDKPolylingualSoftwareDevelopmentKit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neon AI Software Development Kit (SDK)</a> for conversational AI development. Neon AI adds multilingual capabilities and other improvements on top of the Mycroft platform.

The Neon AI SDK runs on Ubuntu and Windows virtual machines. Their assistant is available on Ubuntu devices, Android phones, the Klat.com chat platform, and can be added to a website via an iFrame with just one line of code. Neon AI has capabilities like changing the wake word through a skill, changing the language the assistant listens and speaks in on the fly, and providing coupons from brands you tell the assistant you like.

Neongecko creates cutting-edge, conversational artificial intelligence. They utilize Mycroft software like <a href="https://mycroft.ai/documentation/adapt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adapt</a>, <a href="https://mycroft.ai/documentation/padatious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Padatious</a>, and <a href="https://market.mycroft.ai/skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mycroft Skills</a> for their Neon AI assistant. This year, Neongecko joined Mycroft at our CES booth to show off their <a href="https://www.neongecko.com/CES2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeonX Polylingual Conversational AI Laptop</a>.

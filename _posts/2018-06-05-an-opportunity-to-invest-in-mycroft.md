[vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" overlay_strength="0.3" shape_divider_position="bottom"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_position="all" background_color_opacity="1" background_hover_color_opacity="1" column_shadow="none" column_border_radius="none" width="1/1" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][vc_column_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal here at Mycroft has remained a constant. We are building a voice assistant that runs anywhere and interacts exactly like a person. When the technology is completed people who talk to Mycroft won’t know whether they are talking to a human or a machine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Together we’re going to put this technology within reach of everyone – individuals, small businesses, doctors, pilots – everyone who can benefit from it. That means Big Tech won’t have a stranglehold on voice technology. It also means that people who care about user agency and privacy will have a choice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the path toward our goal, we’ve solved a lot of difficult technical problems. We’ve worked hard to attract talented team members and build the trust of the wider open source community. We’ve built partnerships with open source leaders like Mozilla, KDE, and Ubuntu and worked with companies like Jaguar Land Rover, Sprint and Hewlett Packard to explore the future of voice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38603 size-full" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/partner-logos-1.svg" alt="" width="1200" height="190" />We’ve also received significant investments from accelerators like TechStars and 500 Startups as well as professional investors like Greenbice Venture Capital, Kika Capital, TechNexus Venture Collaborative, T2M Capital, Northland Angels, MTC, Social Starts and Deep Space Ventures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38601" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/logos-INVESTORS.svg" alt="" />But $2.5M in investment is not enough to achieve our goals. We need to improve our marketing efforts, recruit a sales team and most importantly, hire additional developers. To build Alexa our friends at Amazon made three acquisitions and assigned hundreds of employees to the project. Here at Mycroft, we benefit from a great community, but we need additional resources to achieve our goal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Past fundraising efforts at Mycroft have only been available to accredited investors: wealthy individuals who make more than $200,000 per year or have more than $1M in assets. Though lots of smaller investors have shown interest, we were unable to accommodate them. Until now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Mycroft, we want our community to benefit from the technology they are helping us build. We want the visionaries who are developing skills, contributing samples, tagging data and interacting with Mycroft every day to be the ones who benefit financially from a voice market that is growing faster than any other segment of technology today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38539" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/market-chart.001.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1170" />So if you are tired of standing on the sidelines while the Venture Capital community and accredited investors are getting all of the early deals. If you believe in an open internet, user agency, privacy and the future of voice. If you are looking for a bit of risk in a fast moving market with an early stage technology. Head over to our campaign and take a look. We enjoy having you as a member of our community and would love to have you as an investor.</span>

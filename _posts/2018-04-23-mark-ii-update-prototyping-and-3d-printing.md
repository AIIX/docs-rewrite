<p class="p2">We are steadily making progress on the Mark II, and getting closer and closer to being production-ready. We were in the prototype stage when we launched on Kickstarter (btw, we're still on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mycroft-mark-ii-the-open-voice-assistant#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiegogo</a>), and now we are refining and tweaking every aspect to make sure Mark II is even better. Here are a couple of aspects we are focusing on:</p>

<ol>
 	<li class="p2"><strong>Acoustic Design:</strong> Making sure that Mark II has good sound is a high priority, so we have been trying various different shapes and methods to improve the performance. Getting great sound out of a small enclosure is tricky, but we have arrived at a good setup. We are using a sealed and isolated acoustic chamber within our main enclosure just for sound (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matryoshka doll</a>). The acoustic enclosure is also ported to improve performance on the low end.</li>
 	<li><strong>Design for Manufacture (DFM):</strong> Some of the decisions we made in the prototype stage weren't the best for manufacturing. We have gone back to the drawing board on some of the parts. We are reducing the complexity of some of the parts to make sure they can be molded more easily, and we are reducing the part count by combining parts when possible.</li>
</ol>

At this stage, our parts selection is complete, and once we finalize some aspects of the design, we will be getting quotes from contract manufacturers. Designing and producing hardware is a slow and steady race, but we're feeling good about our pace.

Excited to see Mark II? <a href="https://community.mycroft.ai/t/mark-ii-update-prototyping-and-3d-printing/3603">Comment</a> and tell us why! And watch for more hardware updates coming soon!

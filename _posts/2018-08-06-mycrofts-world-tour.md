<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft is going global. Next week our CEO, Joshua Montgomery, is beginning a series of talks around international language support and community building. The first meetings will be held in <strong>Reykjavik</strong>, <strong>Amsterdam</strong>, and <strong>Vienna</strong>. If you live in those cities, <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycrofts-world-tour/#help-mycroft-go-global">get in touch</a>! We would love help in coordinating event locations and recruiting community members to get excited about Mycroft.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/languages-are-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diverse and international community</a> is invaluable to a voice assistant. Just by using Mycroft and Opting-In, we gain various accents to improve Wake Word spotting and STT. Exposing the technology to more people worldwide builds a base who can translate Mycroft into their local languages.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft’s next considered stops are <strong>Berlin</strong>, <strong>Paris</strong>, <strong>Madrid</strong>, <strong>Lisbon</strong>, and <strong>Barcelona</strong>. If you live in or near those cities and can help arrange an event, spread the word, or just want to know when plans finalize, please fill out </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mycrofts-world-tour/#help-mycroft-go-global"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or reach out to us at </span><a href="mailto:hello@mycroft.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hello@mycroft.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<h2>How Mycroft Learns a New Language</h2>
We've <a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/languages-are-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a blog</a> on everything that's needed to make a voice assistant speak a new language. The last post was a high-level and technical overview. We've got some updates now:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re putting the finishing touches on a translation suite that will let skills and dialogue be translated from one language to another.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">For STT, <a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voice.mozilla.org</a> is now collecting recordings in 15 languages and localizing for another 20.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">For TTS, our <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mimic</a> suite for collecting recordings and training a voice is coming soon.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To make use of these systems for internationalization, we benefit from recruiting contributors for translation, voice recording, and coordinating local tech communities excited about voice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Introductions to groups are also appreciated. We would love to work with local companies who could use a voice assistant who speaks the local language, and any educational institutions and governments with interest in preserving and utilizing the local language.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the events for local language support, Joshua will be presenting on early-stage startup fundraising. If you or someone you know would like to learn how we’ve used crowdfunding to build Mycroft from an idea in a makerspace to an international company building a large open source voice project, let us know.</span>

The team is hard at work behind the scenes making sure they do their best to deliver product to those who back our crowdfunding campaigns. Instead of staying quiet for weeks during that process I thought I would share a few photos our CEO, Joshua Montgomery, took while on his recent travels around the country taking meetings with people about Mycroft.

In these photos you might recognize a few famous locations around the country and know where he is visiting. Others might be a bit more challenging to identify. In the coming months he will be taking a relatively similar tour around the country and will be available to attend meetups and maybe have drinks. Send me a note (social@mycroft.ai) if you live in Boulder, Denver, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and New York and I will let you know when he is making his next trip.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost halfway there!!!!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.startengine.com/mycroft-ai?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cheer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40203 size-full" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Open-Future-Table-500px.png" alt="Mycroft builds AI for everyone, and we want to give anyone the ability to invest in AI" width="400" height="400" /></a>With 490 new Investors and counting, we thought we would give you a little update on the process of the <a href="https://www.startengine.com/mycroft-ai?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cheer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title III offering over at StartEngine</a>. Since we started this process we have been set on welcoming 1000 new Investors to our company. We want passionate people looking to participate in the fastest growing industry. People who know that business models based in marketing and spying aren’t the way to win. The opportunity to invest in AI and voice has never been better.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal from the beginning was to get the </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/why-we-want-1000-investors-on-our-cap-table/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">real cheerleaders on the bus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and ensure that we only attract people with the passion to join us. I can overwhelmingly say that this process has been a success in that regards. Not only do we have more cheerleaders for Mycroft, we have more diversity. Diversity leads to innovation, and innovation - for us at least - means that we push new technology out into the world for others to use and expand upon. Things like</span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/mimic-2-is-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mimic2, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the new TTS that Michael and Keith worked on, or </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/blog/introducing-precise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Matthew and Mikhail created. We’re especially proud of the work that the Community has done on Skills, facial recognition, Skill routines, and even the start of some work in solving dementia and Alzheimer's from </span><a href="https://really.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what else can our Investors and Community members do to cheerlead? Well there is a lot, but since this is one of the most common questions I get, here are a few:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Spread the word about Mycroft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whether that is a conversation with friends or just a post about why you joined up to be part of this company. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers can </span><b>build Skills </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and even contribute to the core code. Thanks to Kathy, there is great documentation found </span><a href="https://mycroft.ai/documentation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help us by</span><b> Opting-In</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build out our Machine Learning. If you log into home.mycroft.ai you will be able to help us by going </span><a href="https://home.mycroft.ai/#/setting/basic?_k=j1eqkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and clicking “I agree” at the bottom. Want to know what we use it for? Head over to the “Tagging” tab on home.mycroft.ai and see what we are doing. Go ahead and see if you can knock someone off the leaderboard while you are there. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Record a video of you using Mycroft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We love to share out our Community doing cool things with the software. I am personally really excited to see the next releases of how to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytKUTBfjnQI&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wake up your devices without using your voice. </span></a></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quote from StartEngine: </span></h3>
<em>Thanks for your email Joshua - very much appreciated - and it's precisely this </em>personalised<em> approach that attracted me to the opportunity to invest in Mycroft.</em>

<em>Firstly, you probably don't remember but you gave me a very respectful and </em>personalised<em> response to my newbie questions before I took the plunge into the Mycroft Kickstarter Project. I was actually really pleasantly surprised by that. That got me off to a good start and so when the opportunity to invest in the company came around I looked at it and then thought 'Why not'?</em>

<em>Secondly, it's not often that the opportunity comes around to invest in a technology company at a price I can afford, particularly from Australia.</em>

<em>Lastly, but really </em>importantly<em>, I genuinely believe in the technology and would like to see it succeed, up against the big boys. While I'm older and no technology expert, I just have niggling doubts about the Google and Apple platforms. With data ownership, data privacy and data security becoming such issues generally I feel your approach is a very important alternative for us all, into the future.</em>

<em>Congratulations and I'm really thrilled to be along for the ride!</em>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is less than a month left to be a part of this journey with us! Help us reach our goal of 1000 diverse, passionate, and excited Investors in Mycroft AI.</span></h3>

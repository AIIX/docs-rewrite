<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mycroft is happy to share that the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/q-bo-one-your-open-source-personal-robot-assistant/reft/1649210/mycroftpost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q.bo One Robot</a> by TheCorpora</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now has Mycroft available to all users. Thanks to great work by Mycroft and Q.bo Community Member @malevolent, all Q.Bo One users will be able to turn their robot friend into a full-featured voice assistant.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Mycroft’s open platform, Q.bo users can choose the wake word and voice of their assistant, and build great new skills to interact with the Q.bo environment. Existing Q.bo users will be able to add Mycroft to their devices soon, and new Q.bo One robots will ship with Mycroft built in!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.bo One is the interactive, open robot for makers, developers, kids, and educators. It’s also based on RaspberryPi and Arduino, so Mycroft is right at home on Q.bo’s hardware. Q.bo was made to introduce low-cost interactive robots to the world. Their goal is to help people learn more about robotics and the opportunities it can bring.</span>
